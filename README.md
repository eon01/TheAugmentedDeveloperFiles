## About the Book

The Augmented Developer is a comprehensive guide to AI-assisted coding. It covers everything from the use of AI in **code completion**, **generation**, **refactoring**, **security**, and **bug detection**, to the creation of **custom model chains** and **AI assistants**.

The guide dives into advanced **prompt engineering** techniques and best practices used to maximize the potential of AI in coding. It also explores the **ethical** and **technical** implications of using generative AI in coding. Moreover, it looks into the **future impacts** of AI in coding and its potential to change the developer role as we know it.

Across the chapters of The Augmented Developer, you will:

- Discover the Fusion of Pair Programming and AI: Learn how AI-assisted coding is reshaping the dynamics of pair programming and remote work. Understand how these tools not only support but also enhance the overall coding experience.

- Unpack GitHub Copilot: Dive into the specifics of **GitHub Copilot**, from its foundational AI training to its real-world application in coding. This section breaks down its features, pricing, and setup, making it practical for you to start using it in your projects right away.

- Learn How to Use GitHub Copilot Effectively: Master the art of using **GitHub Copilot** to boost your productivity. From **writing code**, **debugging**, **refactoring**, **security hardening**, **unit testing**, **documentation**, **code reviews**, **pull requests**, **context-aware prompting**, and more.  You'll gain a deep understanding of how to leverage GitHub Copilot to its full potential.

- Explore a Spectrum of AI Coding Assistants and Agents: Get acquainted with the broad landscape of AI coding tools available today: **Tabnine**, **DeepCode**, **fauxpilot**, **privy**, **aider**, **Devin**, **SWE-Agent**, **Codeium**, **Tabby**, **CodeGeeX**, **Amazon CodeWhisperer**, **AskCodi**, **Blackbox AI**, **Bito**, and many more.. We'll compare their features, assess their impacts, and discuss their potential applications.

- Master Prompt Engineering for Developer Productivity: Learn how to write better prompts for GitHub Copilot, ChatGPT and AI coding assistants. This section will guide you through the process of crafting prompts that yield the best results. From **Few-Shot Learning**, **Chain of Thoughts**, **Self Consistency**, **Tree of Thoughts**, **Autonomous Agents**, **General Knowledge Prompting**, and more, you'll gain a deep understanding of how to maximize the potential of AI in coding using the right prompts.
