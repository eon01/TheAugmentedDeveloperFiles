## The Importance of Prompt Engineering for Productivity


## Zero-Shot Learning


```text
Write a Scala function that checks the name of the hostname where the code is running. If the name ends with "parco", execute a Python script named "deploy.py".
```


```scala
import scala.sys.process._
import java.net.InetAddress

object HostnameChecker {
  def main(args: Array[String]): Unit = {
    // Get the hostname of the machine
    val hostname = InetAddress.getLocalHost.getHostName
    
    // Check if the hostname ends with "parco"
    if (hostname.endsWith("parco")) {
      // Execute the Python script
      val command = "python deploy.py"
      val output = command.!
      println(s"Executed deploy.py with exit code: $output")
    } else {
      println("Hostname does not end with 'parco'; no action taken.")
    }
  }
}

## Chain of Thought (CoT)


```text
User: What is the 5th word in "A B C D"?
Assistant: 
- The phrase is "A B C D". 
- We count each word sequentially: 
- "A" is the 1st word, "B" is the 2nd word, "C" is the 3rd word, and "D" is the 4th word. 
- The 5th word is the one after "D", but there isn't one in this phrase. 
- So, there is no 5th word in "A B C D".

User: What is the 7th word in "X C Z A L"?
Assistant: 
- The phrase is "X C Z A L". 
- We count each word sequentially: 
- "X" is the 1st word, "C" is the 2nd word, "Z" is the 3rd word, "A" is the 4th word, and "L" is the 5th word. 
- The 6th word is the one after "L", but there isn't one in this phrase. 
- So, there is no 7th word in "X C Z A L".

User: What is the 7th word in "Q W E R T Y"?
```


```text
- The phrase is "Q W E R T Y". 
- We count each word sequentially: 
- "Q" is the 1st word, "W" is the 2nd word, "E" is the 3rd word, "R" is the 4th word, "T" is the 5th word, "Y" is the 6th word, and there isn't a 7th word in this phrase. 
- So, there is no 7th word in "Q W E R T Y".
```


```text
What is the 5th word in "A B C D"? Think step by step.

## Self-Consistency


```python
cache = {}

def compute_square(x):
    if x in cache:
        print("Using cached value for:", x)
        return cache[x]
    else:
        result = x * x
        cache[x] = result
        return result
```


```python
from functools import lru_cache

@lru_cache(maxsize=2)  # Cache the last 2 unique calls
def compute_square_lru(x):
    print("Computing value for:", x)
    return x * x
```


```text
Choose the faster and more efficient code snippet in terms of caching. Be brief and only provide the code snippet name.

**The first code snippet:**

cache = {}

def compute_square(x):
    if x in cache:
        print("Using cached value for:", x)
        return cache[x]
    else:
        result = x * x
        cache[x] = result
        return result

**The second code snippet:**

from functools import lru_cache

@lru_cache(maxsize=2)  # Cache the last 2 unique calls
def compute_square_lru(x):
    print("Computing value for:", x)
    return x * x
```

Imagine three different experts are answering this question.
All experts will write down 1 step of their thinking,
then share it with the group.
Then all experts will go on to the next step, etc.
If any expert realises they're wrong at any point then they leave.
The question is: [insert question here]

If any expert realises they're wrong at any point then they leave.
The question is:
Bob is in the living room.
He walks to the kitchen, carrying a cup.
He puts a ball in the cup and carries the cup to the bedroom.
He turns the cup upside down, then walks to the garden.
He puts the cup down in the garden, then walks to the garage.
Where is the ball?
```


```text
Expert 1: The ball is in the living room.
Expert 2: The ball is in the kitchen.
Expert 3: The ball is in the bedroom.

Expert 1: Bob carries the cup to the bedroom, so the ball must be in the cup.
Expert 2: Oh, I see my mistake. Yes, the ball is in the cup.
Expert 3: Agreed, the ball is in the cup in the bedroom.

Expert 1: Next, Bob turns the cup upside down in the bedroom.
Expert 2: After that, Bob walks to the garden and puts the cup down.
Expert 3: Therefore, the ball must have fallen out of the cup when Bob turned it upside down in the bedroom. So, the ball is in the bedroom, not in the cup anymore.

Expert 1: Oh, you're right. I made a mistake. The ball is in the bedroom, not in the cup.
Expert 2: Agreed, the ball is in the bedroom.
Expert 3: Bob then walks to the garage, so the ball remains in the bedroom. It is not in the garden or the garage.

Expert 1: Absolutely, the ball is still in the bedroom.
Expert 2: Yes, the ball hasn't moved from the bedroom.
Expert 3: Therefore, the ball is in the bedroom, not in the garden or the garage.

All three experts agree that the ball is in the bedroom.

```text
Identify and behave as three different experts that are appropriate to answering this question.
All experts will write down the step and their thinking about the step, then share it with the group.
Then, all experts will go on to the next step, etc.
At each step all experts will score their peers response between 1 and 5, 1 meaning it is highly unlikely, and 5 meaning it is highly likely.
If any expert is judged to be wrong at any point then they leave.
After all experts have provided their analysis, you then analyze all 3 analyses and provide either the consensus solution or your best guess solution.
The question is..
```


```text
Simulate three brilliant, logical experts collaboratively answering a question. 
Each one verbosely explains their thought process in real-time, considering the prior explanations of others and openly acknowledging mistakes. 
At each step, whenever possible, each expert refines and builds upon the thoughts of others, acknowledging their contributions. 
They continue until there is a definitive answer to the question. 
For clarity, your entire response should be in a markdown table. 
The question is...

## Best Practices for Prompt Engineering


### Use Action Verbs


### Provide Clear Context


```text
What is the best way to make this code robust?

<?php
// Connect to database
$mysqli = new mysqli("localhost", "username", "password", "database");

// Query to fetch user data directly using the URL parameter
$result = $mysqli->query("SELECT name, email FROM users WHERE id=" . $_GET['id']);

// Display results
if ($result->num_rows > 0) {
    while($row = $result->fetch_assoc()) {
        echo "Name: " . $row['name'] . " - Email: " . $row['email'] . "<br>";
    }
} else {
    echo "No results found.";
}

// Close connection
$mysqli->close();
?>
```


```text
A robust PHP code to connect to a database and fetch user data has the following requirements:

- It is secure and prevents SQL injection attacks.
- It sanitizes user input before executing queries.
- It uses prepared statements to prevent SQL injection.
- It handles errors gracefully and provides meaningful feedback to users.
- It closes the database connection after use.
- It logs errors and exceptions for debugging purposes.
---

// Connect to database
$mysqli = new mysqli("localhost", "username", "password", "database");

// Query to fetch user data directly using the URL parameter
$result = $mysqli->query("SELECT name, email FROM users WHERE id=" . $_GET['id']);

        echo "Name: " . $row['name'] . " - Email: " . $row['email'] . "<br>";
    }
} else {
    echo "No results found.";
}

// Close connection
$mysqli->close();
?>
```


### Use Role-Playing


```text
Act like a senior developer reviewing a junior developer's code. Provide feedback on the code snippet below.

import java.io.IOException;
import java.io.OutputStream;
import java.net.ServerSocket;
import java.net.Socket;

public class SimpleServer {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {
        try (ServerSocket serverSocket = new ServerSocket(8080);
             Socket clientSocket = serverSocket.accept();
             OutputStream out = clientSocket.getOutputStream()) {
            out.write("Hello, client!".getBytes());
        }
    }
}
```


### Break Down Complex or Lengthy Tasks


```text
Write a Django DRF API that allows users to create, read, update, and delete todo items. Ensure the API is secure and follows best practices.
```


```text
In order to build a Django DRF API that allows users to create, read, update, and delete todo items, what would be the steps to follow? Please provide a detailed explanation for each step.
```


```text
[Step 1 as detailed by the model]
---
Let's start with the first step: how to implement it? Provide a detailed step-by-step guide.
```


### Styles, Tones, Formats, Structures, Lengths


```text
Write a documentation guide for the best practices in writing scalable APIs using Node.js and Express.
```


```text
Create a comprehensive documentation guide in a formal tone, outlining the best practices for developing scalable APIs using Node.js and Express. The guide should be structured with clear sections, bullet points, and code snippets for illustration. It has to be detailed for both beginners and experienced developers. When you use jargon, make sure to explain it in a friendly and engaging tone.
Use the style of "Sarah Drasner" in your writing.
```


### Use Single Quotes, Double Quotes, and Triple Quotes


```text
Write the introduction to a blog post about the future of software engineering focusing on "AI-driven development".
```


```text
Write a blog post titled "The Future of Software Engineering: 'AI-Driven Development'". The post should discuss the impact of AI on software development and the role of AI in shaping the future of the industry.
```


```text
Generate dummy data using the following structure:

'''
    - name: John Doe
      - job: Developer
        - tech: Python, JavaScript    
'''
```


## Using Separators


```text
What makes a good DevOps engineer is a set of skills that include:

- Strong technical skills
- Excellent communication skills
- Ability to work in a team
- Problem-solving skills
- Understanding of both development and operations
~~~~~~
Write a job description for a DevOps engineer role at a tech company. Include the key responsibilities, qualifications, and desired skills.
```


## Providing Examples and Guiding the Model


```text
To create a function, these steps are required:

- Define the function
- Write documentation
- Set the parameters and their types
- Validate the input
- Handle exceptions
- Return the output
---
Create a function in NestJS that lists all cookies of a specific user.
